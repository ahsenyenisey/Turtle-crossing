Turtle Crossing Game
Welcome to the Turtle Crossing game! 🐢🌿

In this simple but fun game, your goal is to help a cute little turtle navigate a flowing river while avoiding moving, colorful obstacles like logs. 
The game tests your reflexes and timing as you guide the turtle safely to the other side.

How to play?

Use the up arrow key “↑” to move the turtle upwards (towards the goal).
Avoid moving obstacles and move safely across the screen.
As you progress the game becomes more challenging and the obstacles move faster.
