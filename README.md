***Turtle Crossing Game***


**Welcome to the Turtle Crossing game! 🐢🌿**

_In this simple but fun game, your goal is to help a cute little turtle navigate a flowing river while avoiding moving, colorful obstacles like logs. 
The game tests your reflexes and timing as you guide the turtle safely to the other side._

**_How to play?_**

_Use the up arrow key “↑” to move the turtle upwards (towards the goal).
Avoid moving obstacles and move safely across the screen.
As you progress the game becomes more challenging and the obstacles move faster._
